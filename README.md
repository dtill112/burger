Eat the Burger

*The work in this repository is an application using node, handlebars, JS and a number of other systems. The application also uses a backend database called mySQLWorkbench.

*The functionality of the application gives the user the ability to add in a "burger" that they choose (by typing it into the form), and then, if the user chooses, to "Devour That" upon the clicking of the button with the same name.

*From a backend perspective, when the user submits a new burger, that data is pushed to the SQL database where it is stored until the programmer decides to scrub the database.

*When the "Devour That" button is clicked, that information is also sent to the database where a numerical value is assigned to the row of data that correlates to the button that was clicked in the DOM. That number is translated by the application into either Eaten, or Uneaten (which leaves that row unchanged relative to when that row of data was submitted initially).

*Bootstrap was also used on the front end to format the page.
